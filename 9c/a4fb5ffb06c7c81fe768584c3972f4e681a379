=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=
=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80

  I've opened a [PR] with input from @dra27 and @avsm adding support for
  Nix depexts (system dependencies) to Opam.

  Opam supports system dependencies for other platforms by invoking the
  system package manager, e.g. `apt-get install ...'. However Nix is a
  bit different, as in general installing a package to your system
  doesn't create the development environment required to use it; it will
  only add executables to your `$PATH'. To find, for example, objects
  files, outside of a Nix derivation you can use `nix-shell' and it's
  descendant `nix develop'. E.g.:

  =E2=94=8C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80
  =E2=94=82 $ nix-shell -p gmp
  =E2=94=82 $ echo $NIX_LDFLAGS
  =E2=94=82 -rpath /nix/store/20g5iw2r512gnfrdr4imp2y940v3vlif-shell/lib  -=
L/nix/store/rx6nkd40819acppajq29g1hxa4d9r35f-gmp-with-cxx-6.3.0/lib -L/nix/=
store/rx6nkd40819acppajq29g1hxa4d9r35f-gmp-with-cxx-6.3.0/lib
  =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80

  We support Nix depexts with Opam in a similar way. A Nix derivation is
  build with the desired packages as inputs, and the resulting
  environment is output as a file in the Opam switch in a format that
  Opam can parse. This `nix.env' file is a symlink into the Nix store,
  so acts as a garbage collection root =E2=80=93 packages won't be removed =
from
  the store while this file exists. Opam outputs these environment
  variables on an invocation of `opam env'.

  This fixes issues such as
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-and-nixos-is-there-an-alternative-to-ni=
x-shell/13726>.

  While the primary use case is on NixOS, this depext mechanism could be
  used on other platforms to provide a consistent experience including
  other Linux distributions, BSDs, (and possibly [even windows] in the
  future).

  Nixpkgs typically only packages one version of a package at a time,
  but I'm working on versioned depexts with previous version of Nixpkgs
  as outlined [here].

  I'm keen to get people's opinions and perspective on this!

  I am happy to announce the release of ppx_deriving.6.0.2 and
  ppx_deriving_yojson.3.8.0, the first release of those packages in
  years!

  The main feature here is the port of [ppx_deriving]'s standard
  derivers (`[@@deriving show, make, ord, eq, ...]') and
  [ppx_deriving_yojson] to [ppxlib]'s `Deriving' api.  There are no
  changes to how you'd use those derivers but many benefits:
  =E2=80=A2 Better performances and better integration with other ppx-es as=
 the
    code is now generated as part of ppxlib's driver main AST rewriting
    phase rather than in a separate, dedicated phase.
  =E2=80=A2 They can now be used with `[@@deriving_inline]'
  =E2=80=A2 None of them will break the location invariant required by merl=
in
    anymore, fixing a long lasting bug and providing a much better user
    experience.

  You can find the full release notes for ppx_deriving [here] and for
  ppx_deriving_yojson [here].

  I'd like to thank @sim642 for all their work on the ppxlib ports and
  their patience, and all our other contributors.

  I'd also like to thank the [OCaml Software Foundation] who has been
  funding my work on those releases.

  I'm very pleased to present you [an article] with a collection of
  small illustrations and examples of how to use the `destruct' command
  to generate patterns in the presence of pattern matches.

  The command has been present in [Merlin] for several years (and
  accessible via [OCaml-LSP]) but, as the various changelogs relating to
  Merlin mention, we have spent some time polishing it and adapting it
  to the evolutions of OCaml, making it more stable (essentially in the
  presence of punning) and taking into account the changes made to the
  representation of functions (and their parameters).

  The aim of the article is to show how the `destruct' command works in
  a number of very concrete cases, and ends with an example (a little
  artificial for the purposes of the article and for teaching purposes)
  which shows how to use `destruct' interactively.

  Greetings Cameleers,

  We would like to share with you our latest *Flambda2 Snippet*:
  [Flambda2 Ep. 2: Loopifying Tail-Recursive Functions]!

  Indeed, today's topic is what is called `Loopify', one of the many
  optimisation algorithms found in the `Flambda2' optimising compiler
  project.

  We believe `Loopify' is a nicely representative piece of software for
  our readers to grasp at the general design and philosophy for all
  optimisations available in `Flambda2'! Hopefully, you will do too!

  Be sure to check out the [`Flambda2 Ep.0'] article to get all the
  context for the project itself and the series of blog posts!

  In any case, we await your feedback below, and hope that you will
  enjoy reading this post, and all ensuing ones!

  Kind regards, The OCamlPro Team

    Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP) stage: a version of Dune that can build
    non-trivial projects like [OCaml.org] and [Bonsai]. With a working
    MVP, the team is shifting their focus to putting Dune package
    management in the hands of the community. To that end, we have
    started the Dune Developer Preview Program, where we will test Dune
    package management with users and refine the user experience in
    preparation for a final release.
  =E2=80=A2 The opam team released a second beta of [opam 2.2], and with it,
    opened the [final PR] to add support for Windows OCaml to the
    opam-repository. Once the PR is merged, opam 2.2 will be usable with
    the upstream opam-repository on Windows, paving the way for a third
    beta very soon, and a Release Candidate next.
  =E2=80=A2 The odoc team has finalized the initial design for Odoc 3.0 and
    opened several [RFCs] to gather community input. We've implemented a
    new [Odoc driver] that follows the Odoc 3.0 design and have already
    started prototyping key parts of the design.
  =E2=80=A2 Merlin's project-wide references query is getting very close to
    release. The necessary [compiler PR] has been merged and included in
    OCaml 5.2, and the [Dune rules PR] has been merged and included in
    Dune 3.16. The next steps are to merge the [PR in Merlin] itself and
    the small patch in OCaml LSP.
  =E2=80=A2 The set of standard derivers shipped with `ppx_deriving.std'
    (i.e. `[@@deriving show, make, ord, eq, ...]') as well as
    `ppx_deriving_yojson' are now directly written against Ppxlib's
    API. That impacts developers in two ways. First, it allows you to
    enjoy reliable editor features in projects with those derivers
    (Ppxlib preserves Merlin's location invariants). Second, you can
    avoid a hard dependency on those derivers by using Ppxlib's
    `deriving_inline' feature on them. Thanks a lot to @sim642 for all
    your work and very kind patience, @NathanReb for reviewing and
    release managing, and everyone else involved!

  *Contributed by:* @rgrinberg (Tarides), @Leonidas-from-XIV (Tarides),
   @gridbugs (Tarides), @Alizter

  *Why:* Unify OCaml tooling under a single command line for all
   development workflows. This addresses one of the most important pain
   points [reported by the community].

  *What:* Prototyping the integration of package management into Dune
   using opam as a library. We're introducing a `dune pkg lock' command
   to generate a lock file and enhancing `dune build' to handle
   dependencies in the lock file. More details in the [Dune RFC].

  *Summary:*

  Over the past three months, significant progress has been made in
  adding Dune's support for package management. We are thrilled to
  report that our prototypes have reached a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
  stage: an experimental version of Dune package management that can be
  used to build non-trivial projects, including OCaml.org and Bonsai,
  which we are using in our tests.

  There is still a long way to go, but with this milestone reached, we
  are now shifting our focus from prototyping to putting the feature in
  the hands of the community. We are moving to testing the new Dune
  feature with users, and in particular, now that we have a good
  understanding of the technical blockers and their workarounds, we will
  be focusing on validating and refining the developer experience (DX)
  of Dune package management in preparation for a first release.

  To that end, the Dune team has started a Dune Developer Preview
  Program. We're currently testing the Developer Preview of package
  management with selected beta testers, and once the biggest issues
  have been addressed, we'll be opening it to the broader community.

  *Contributed by:* @rjbou (OCamlPro), @kit-ty-kate (Ahrefs), @dra27
   (Tarides), @AltGr (OCamlPro)

  *Why:* Enhance OCaml's viability on Windows by integrating native opam
   and `opam-repository' support, fostering a larger community, and more
   Windows-friendly packages.

  *What:* Releasing opam 2.2 with native Windows support, making the
   official `opam-repository' usable on Windows platforms.

  *Summary:*

  The opam team is getting closer to a final release of opam 2.2 with
  support for Windows. In the past months, we have released a second
  beta of opam 2.2, addressing a number of issues reported by users on
  previous releases, including Windows issues.

  Excitingly, we also opened the [final PR] adding support for Windows
  OCaml to opam-repository. With the PR merged, the opam team is
  expecting to be able to move to a Release Candidate in June.

  Stay tuned for more exciting news and releases in the coming weeks and
  months!

   (Tarides), Luke Maurer (Jane Street)

  *Why:* Improving local documentation generation workflow will help
   package authors write better documentation for their packages, and
   consolidating the different `odoc' documentation generators will help
   make continuous improvements to `odoc' available to a larger
   audience.

  *What:* We will create conventions that drivers must follow to ensure
   that their output will be functional. Once established, we will
   update the Dune rules to follow these rules, access new `odoc'
   features (e.g., source rendering), and provide similar
   functionalities to docs.ocaml.org (a navigational sidebar, for
   instance). This will effectively make Dune usable to generate
   OCaml.org package documentation.

  *Summary:*

  The Odoc team has made significant progress on the upcoming Odoc
  3.0. We held productive in-person meetings in Paris to discuss crucial
  design aspects such as the CLI, source code rendering, and
  references. These discussions led to the publications of RFCs for the
  various components of the design specification.

  We also started implementing a new Odoc driver that adheres to the new
  design for testing purposes, and began prototyping several of the new
  features.

  While discussions on the RFCs and specific features are still ongoing,
  we are very excited to have a solid set of design specifications under
  community review and to have begun implementing key parts of the new
  design.

   (INRIA), @gasche (INRIA), @emillon (Tarides), @rgrinberg (Jane
   Street), @Julow (Tarides)

  *Why:* Enhance code navigation and refactoring for developers by
   providing project-wide reference editor features, aligning OCaml with
   the editor experience found in other languages.

  *What:* Introducing `ocamlmerlin server occurrences' and LSP
   `textDocument/references' support, extending compiler's Shapes for
   global occurrences and integrating these features in Dune, Merlin,
   and OCaml LSP.

  *Summary:*

  The past few months have seen fantastic progress on releasing Merlin's
  project-wide reference query: The compiler PR got merged and included
  in the now released OCaml 5.2; The Dune rules PR got merged, and with
  it significant performance improvements have been made on the indexing
  tool. The [final PR] in Merlin is open and under review. That PR as
  well as the small LSP patch to support the feature are about to be
  merged.

  The PR on Merlin also adds support for the feature in the Merlin
  server plug-in for Emacs. Support for the Merlin server plug-in for
  Vim has been added separately. All editor plug-ins based on LSP will
  support the new feature automatically.

  *Activities:*

  =E2=80=A2 We followed up on our compiler PR to improve performance for sh=
ape
    aliases weak reduction. It got merged, and made it into OCaml
    5.2.0. =E2=80=93 [ocaml/ocaml#13001]
  =E2=80=A2 We improved the Dune rules that drive the indexer: Simplified t=
he
    rules, added benchmarks, discussed and improved performance. The PR
    got merged, and made it into Dune 3.16. - [ocaml/dune#10422]
  =E2=80=A2 We polished the indexer `ocaml-index': Profiled it and improved=
 its
    speed by a factor ~2, and improved its CLI.
  =E2=80=A2 We added a `:MerlinOccurrencesProjectWide' command to the Vim
    plug-in based on the Merlin server - [ocaml/merlin#1767]

  Welcome to the May 2024 edition of the OCaml.org newsletter! This
  update has been compiled by the OCaml.org team. You can find [previous
  updates] on Discuss.

  Our goal is to make OCaml.org the best resource for anyone who wants
  to get started and be productive in OCaml. The OCaml.org newsletter
  provides an update on our progress towards that goal and an overview
  of the changes we are working on.

  We couldn't do it without all the amazing people who help us review,
  revise, and create better OCaml documentation and work on issues. Your
  participation enables us to so much more than we could just by
  ourselves. Thank you!

  This newsletter covers:
  =E2=80=A2 *Recipes for the OCaml Cookbook:* Help us make the OCaml Cookbo=
ok
     really useful by contributing and reviewing recipes for common
     tasks!
  =E2=80=A2 *Community & Marketing Pages Rework:* We have UI designs for the
     reworked and new pages of the community section and are starting to
     implement these. We made progress towards showing videos from the
     community on the OCaml Planet.
  =E2=80=A2 *General Improvements:* As usual, we also worked on general
     maintenance and improvements, so we're highlighting some of the
     work that happened below.

  The OCaml Cookbook is a place where OCaml developers share how to
  solve common tasks using packages from the ecosystem.

  A recipe is a code sample and explanations on how to perform a task
  using a combination of open source libraries.

  The Cookbook is live at [ocaml.org/cookbook], but there are not a lot
  of recipes published yet.

  When the cookbook was merged, all pull requests to the cookbook branch
  were automatically closed. We recreated these pull requests and they
  are ready for review.

  Here's how you can help:

  1. Review [open pull requests for cookbook recipes]!
  2. Contribute new recipes and tasks for the cookbook!

  This month, we made some progress towards adding videos from the OCaml
  community (e.g., from YouTube and watch.ocaml.org) to the OCaml
  Planet.

  Since the size of the OCaml Planet RSS feed grew so large that
  automation tools (`dlvr.it') could no longer process it, we reduced
  the timeframe for posts to show up in the RSS feed to the last 90
  days.

  Contributor [@ishar19] opened a pull request to add an RSS feed for
  the Community/Events page. This will allow posting new events to
  various social media automatically and allow you to subscribe to the
  Events RSS feed with a RSS reader of your choice.

  We have [UI designs for the reworked and new pages of the community
  section] and we are opening small issues for contributors to
  help. :orange_heart:

  On May 27, [Divyanka Chaudhari] started working with the team, as an
  Outreachy intern. She's implementing support for running the exercises
  as a stand-alone project, either in GitHub Codespace, in `repl.it',
  using Jupyter or LearnOcaml.

  ## General Improvements and Data Additions

  *Notable Changes:*
  =E2=80=A2 We restructured the main navigation to have a "Tools" section t=
hat
    holds the OCaml Platform page and the OCaml compiler releases
    page. This should make the OCaml Platform page easier to find.
  =E2=80=A2 The Changelog can now be found under "News", from the main
    navigation. You can also find the OCaml Planet and the Newsletters
    in this new section.
  =E2=80=A2 The OCaml Language Manual is now served from OCaml.org, instead=
 of
    v2.ocaml.org.
  =E2=80=A2 We added some more links to learning resources to the Resources=
 page
    at <https://ocaml.org/resources>.
  =E2=80=A2 Some documentation updates on "Is OCaml Web Yet?", "Is OCaml GUI
    Yet?", the ThreadSanitizer tutorial, and the "Functors" tutorial.

  =E2=80=A2 *opam init on Windows enhancements*: this beta greatly improves=
 the
     `opam init' user experience on Windows, and the number of
     recognised configurations
  =E2=80=A2 *opam init =E2=80=93cygwin-extra-packages=3D\<pkgs\>*: a new ar=
gument to
     specify additional packages for the internal Cygwin installation
  =E2=80=A2 *Support of user directories containing spaces*: opam now redir=
ects
     the opam root to `C:\opamroot\opam-xxx' when the opam root contains
     spaces on Windows
  =E2=80=A2 *UTF-8 paged =E2=80=93help on Windows* thanks to cmdliner 1.3.0=
 and some
     additional Windows API calls, all the `opam --help' commands now
     display a paged view by default similar to Unix-like systems.
  =E2=80=A2 Many *fixes*, *performance* and general *improvements*

  :open_book: You can read our [blog post] for more information about
  these changes and more, and for even more details you can take a look
  at the [release note] or the [changelog].

Windows issues
=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=95=8C=E2=

  Configuration of Windows is tricky, so please don=E2=80=99t be too
  disheartened if things don=E2=80=99t work instantly. If something doesn=
=E2=80=99t work
  first time, [please do report it], even if you manage to find a way to
  workaround it. If opam didn=E2=80=99t elegantly tell you what was wrong, =
then
  it=E2=80=99s a bug and we=E2=80=99d love to hear about it, rather than en=
ding up with
  a series of workarounds flying around. It=E2=80=99s no problem at all for=
 us
  to receive a bug report which turns out to be user error - we=E2=80=99d f=

  rather that than not hear bugs which are opam=E2=80=99s error! =F0=9F=99=

How to upgrade

=E2=97=8A On Windows

  *BEWARE*: the command shown below is *experimental, use caution* and
   please do report any issues that you are experiencing. If you prefer
   to not use our experimental script, feel free to get the Windows
   binary directly from [the Release Page] and put it in your directory
   of choice instead.

  Now that the [Windows support was merged in opam-repository],

  installing opam is as simple as calling the following command from a
  PowerShell terminal:
  =E2=94=8C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80
  =E2=94=82 Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubus=
ercontent.com/kit-ty-kate/opam/windows-installer/shell/install.ps1) }"
  =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80

  opening a new terminal, and a simple `opam init' will work
  out-of-the-box.

  [Windows support was merged in opam-repository]
  <https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/25861>


=E2=97=8A On Unix-like systems

  To upgrade, simply run:
  =E2=94=8C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80
  =E2=94=82 bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocam=

  =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80=E2=94=80

  We=E2=80=99re planning for an opam 2.2.0~rc1 release later next week, so
  please do report any issue you encounter on our [bug-tracker].

<h3 id=3D"org2411d85">Ryan announced</h3>
<div class=3D"outline-text-3" id=3D"text-org2411d85">
<p>
I've opened a <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5982">PR</a> wi=
th input from @dra27 and @avsm adding support for Nix depexts (system depen=
dencies) to Opam.
</p>

<p>
Opam supports system dependencies for other platforms by invoking the syste=
m package manager, e.g. <code>apt-get install ...</code>. However Nix is a =
bit different, as in general installing a package to your system doesn't cr=
eate the development environment required to use it; it will only add execu=
tables to your <code>$PATH</code>. To find, for example, objects files, out=
side of a Nix derivation you can use <code>nix-shell</code> and it's descen=
dant <code>nix develop</code>. E.g.:
</p>

<pre class=3D"example" id=3D"org724ebf1">
$ nix-shell -p gmp
$ echo $NIX_LDFLAGS
-rpath /nix/store/20g5iw2r512gnfrdr4imp2y940v3vlif-shell/lib  -L/nix/store/=
rx6nkd40819acppajq29g1hxa4d9r35f-gmp-with-cxx-6.3.0/lib -L/nix/store/rx6nkd=
40819acppajq29g1hxa4d9r35f-gmp-with-cxx-6.3.0/lib
</pre>

<p>
We support Nix depexts with Opam in a similar way. A Nix derivation is buil=
d with the desired packages as inputs, and the resulting environment is out=
put as a file in the Opam switch in a format that Opam can parse. This <cod=
e>nix.env</code> file is a symlink into the Nix store, so acts as a garbage=
 collection root &#x2013; packages won't be removed from the store while th=
is file exists. Opam outputs these environment variables on an invocation o=
f <code>opam env</code>.
</p>

<p>
This fixes issues such as <a href=3D"https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-and-n=
ixos-is-there-an-alternative-to-nix-shell/13726">https://discuss.ocaml.org/=
t/opam-and-nixos-is-there-an-alternative-to-nix-shell/13726</a>.
</p>

<p>
While the primary use case is on NixOS, this depext mechanism could be used=
 on other platforms to provide a consistent experience including other Linu=
x distributions, BSDs, (and possibly <a href=3D"https://github.com/NixOS/ni=
x/pull/8901">even windows</a> in the future).
</p>

<p>
Nixpkgs typically only packages one version of a package at a time, but I'm=
 working on versioned depexts with previous version of Nixpkgs as outlined =
<a href=3D"https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/depending-on-non-ocaml-languages-fro=
m-the-opam-repository/12585/6">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm keen to get people's opinions and perspective on this!

<p>
I am happy to announce the release of ppx_deriving.6.0.2 and ppx_deriving_y=
ojson.3.8.0, the first release of those packages in years!
</p>

<p>
The main feature here is the port of <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml-pp=
x/ppx_deriving">ppx_deriving</a>'s standard derivers (<code>[@@deriving sho=
w, make, ord, eq, ...]</code>) and <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/=
ppx_deriving_yojson">ppx_deriving_yojson</a> to <a href=3D"https://github.c=
om/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib">ppxlib</a>'s <code>Deriving</code> api.
There are no changes to how you'd use those derivers but many benefits:
</p>
<ul class=3D"org-ul">
<li>Better performances and better integration with other ppx-es as the cod=
e is now generated as part of ppxlib's driver main AST rewriting phase rath=
er than in a separate, dedicated phase.</li>
<li>They can now be used with <code>[@@deriving_inline]</code></li>
<li>None of them will break the location invariant required by merlin anymo=
re, fixing a long lasting bug and providing a much better user experience.<=
/li>
</ul>

<p>
You can find the full release notes for ppx_deriving <a href=3D"https://git=
hub.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving/releases/tag/v6.0.2">here</a> and for ppx_de=
riving_yojson <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_yojson/r=
eleases/tag/v3.8.0">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to thank @sim642 for all their work on the ppxlib ports and their =
patience, and all our other contributors.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to thank the <a href=3D"https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml Software=
 Foundation</a> who has been funding my work on those releases.

I'm very pleased to present you <a href=3D"https://tarides.com/blog/2024-05=

collection of small illustrations and examples of how to use the <code>dest=
ruct</code> command to generate patterns in the presence of pattern matches=

</p>

<p>
The command has been present in <a href=3D"https://ocaml.org/p/merlin/lates=
t">Merlin</a> for several years (and accessible via <a href=3D"https://ocam=
l.org/p/lsp/latest">OCaml-LSP</a>) but, as the various changelogs relating =
to Merlin mention, we have spent some time polishing it and adapting it to =
the evolutions of OCaml, making it more stable (essentially in the presence=
 of punning) and taking into account the changes made to the representation=
 of functions (and their parameters).
</p>

<p>
The aim of the article is to show how the <code>destruct</code> command wor=
ks in a number of very concrete cases, and ends with an example (a little a=
rtificial for the purposes of the article and for teaching purposes) which =
shows how to use <code>destruct</code> interactively.

Greetings Cameleers,
</p>

<p>
We would like to share with you our latest <b>Flambda2 Snippet</b>: <a href=
=3D"https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2024_05_07_the_flambda2_snippets_2">Flambda2 =
Ep. 2: Loopifying Tail-Recursive Functions</a>!
</p>

<p>
Indeed, today's topic is what is called <code>Loopify</code>, one of the ma=
ny optimisation algorithms found in the <code>Flambda2</code> optimising co=
mpiler project.
</p>

<p>
We believe <code>Loopify</code> is a nicely representative piece of softwar=
e for our readers to grasp at the general design and philosophy for all opt=
imisations
available in <code>Flambda2</code>! Hopefully, you will do too!
</p>

<p>
Be sure to check out the <a href=3D"https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2024_03_18_th=
e_flambda2_snippets_0/"><code>Flambda2 Ep.0</code></a> article to get all t=
he context for the project itself and the series of blog posts!

<p>
In any case, we await your feedback below, and hope that you will enjoy rea=

<p>
Welcome to the eleventh edition of the OCaml Platform newsletter!
</p>

<p>
In this March-May 2024 edition, we are excited to bring you the latest on t=
he OCaml Platform, continuing our tradition of highlighting recent developm=
ents as seen in <a href=3D"https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/platform-newslette=
r">previous editions</a>. To understand the direction we're headed, especia=
lly regarding development workflows and user experience improvements, check=
 out our <a href=3D"https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-roadmap">roadmap</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Highlights:</b>
</p>

<ul class=3D"org-ul">
<li>Explorations on Dune package management have reached a Minimal-Viable-P=
roduct (MVP) stage: a version of Dune that can build non-trivial projects l=
ike <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a> and <a hre=
f=3D"https://github.com/janestreet/bonsai">Bonsai</a>. With a working MVP, =
the team is shifting their focus to putting Dune package management in the =
hands of the community. To that end, we have started the Dune Developer Pre=
view Program, where we will test Dune package management with users and ref=
ine the user experience in preparation for a final release.</li>
<li>The opam team released a second beta of <a href=3D"https://discuss.ocam=
l.org/t/ann-opam-2-2-0-beta2/14461">opam 2.2</a>, and with it, opened the <=
a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/25861">final PR</a>=
 to add support for Windows OCaml to the opam-repository. Once the PR is me=
rged, opam 2.2 will be usable with the upstream opam-repository on Windows,=
 paving the way for a third beta very soon, and a Release Candidate next.</=
li>
<li>The odoc team has finalized the initial design for Odoc 3.0 and opened =
several <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/discussions">RFCs</a> to g=
ather community input. We've implemented a new <a href=3D"https://github.co=
m/ocaml/odoc/pull/1121">Odoc driver</a> that follows the Odoc 3.0 design an=
d have already started prototyping key parts of the design.</li>
<li>Merlin's project-wide references query is getting very close to release=
. The necessary <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13001">compi=
ler PR</a> has been merged and included in OCaml 5.2, and the <a href=3D"ht=
tps://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10422">Dune rules PR</a> has been merged a=
nd included in Dune 3.16. The next steps are to merge the <a href=3D"https:=
//github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1766">PR in Merlin</a> itself and the small =
patch in OCaml LSP.</li>
<li>The set of standard derivers shipped with <code>ppx_deriving.std</code>=
 (i.e. <code>[@@deriving show, make, ord, eq, ...]</code>) as well as <code=
>ppx_deriving_yojson</code> are now directly written against Ppxlib's API. =
That impacts developers in two ways. First, it allows you to enjoy reliable=
 editor features in projects with those derivers (Ppxlib preserves Merlin's=
 location invariants). Second, you can avoid a hard dependency on those der=
ivers by using Ppxlib's <code>deriving_inline</code> feature on them. Thank=
s a lot to @sim642 for all your work and very kind patience, @NathanReb for=
 reviewing and release managing, and everyone else involved!</li>

<p>
<b>Why:</b> Unify OCaml tooling under a single command line for all develop=
ment workflows. This addresses one of the most important pain points <a hre=
f=3D"https://www.dropbox.com/s/omba1d8vhljnrcn/OCaml-user-survey-2020.pdf?d=
l=3D0">reported by the community</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>What:</b> Prototyping the integration of package management into Dune us=
ing opam as a library. We're introducing a <code>dune pkg lock</code> comma=
nd to generate a lock file and enhancing <code>dune build</code> to handle =
dependencies in the lock file. More details in the <a href=3D"https://githu=
b.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7680">Dune RFC</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Summary:</b>=20
</p>

<p>
Over the past three months, significant progress has been made in adding Du=
ne's support for package management. We are thrilled to report that our pro=
totypes have reached a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) stage: an experimental =
version of Dune package management that can be used to build non-trivial pr=
ojects, including OCaml.org and Bonsai, which we are using in our tests.
</p>

<p>
There is still a long way to go, but with this milestone reached, we are no=
w shifting our focus from prototyping to putting the feature in the hands o=
f the community. We are moving to testing the new Dune feature with users, =
and in particular, now that we have a good understanding of the technical b=
lockers and their workarounds, we will be focusing on validating and refini=
ng the developer experience (DX) of Dune package management in preparation =
for a first release.
</p>

<p>
To that end, the Dune team has started a Dune Developer Preview Program. We=
're currently testing the Developer Preview of package management with sele=
cted beta testers, and once the biggest issues have been addressed, we'll b=
e opening it to the broader community.

<p>
<b>Why:</b> Enhance OCaml's viability on Windows by integrating native opam=
 and <code>opam-repository</code> support, fostering a larger community, an=
d more Windows-friendly packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>What:</b> Releasing opam 2.2 with native Windows support, making the off=
icial <code>opam-repository</code> usable on Windows platforms.
</p>

<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
</p>

<p>
The opam team is getting closer to a final release of opam 2.2 with support=
 for Windows. In the past months, we have released a second beta of opam 2.=
2, addressing a number of issues reported by users on previous releases, in=
cluding Windows issues.
</p>

<p>
Excitingly, we also opened the <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/opam-rep=
ository/pull/25861">final PR</a> adding support for Windows OCaml to opam-r=
epository. With the PR merged, the opam team is expecting to be able to mov=
e to a Release Candidate in June.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for more exciting news and releases in the coming weeks and mont=
hs!

<b>Contributed by:</b> @jonludlam (Tarides), @julow (Tarides), @panglesd (T=

</p>

<p>
<b>Why:</b> Improving local documentation generation workflow will help pac=
kage authors write better documentation for their packages, and consolidati=
ng the different <code>odoc</code> documentation generators will help make =
continuous improvements to <code>odoc</code> available to a larger audience.
</p>

<p>
<b>What:</b> We will create conventions that drivers must follow to ensure =
that their output will be functional. Once established, we will update the =
Dune rules to follow these rules, access new <code>odoc</code> features (e.=
g., source rendering), and provide similar functionalities to docs.ocaml.or=
g (a navigational sidebar, for instance). This will effectively make Dune u=
sable to generate OCaml.org package documentation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
</p>

<p>
The Odoc team has made significant progress on the upcoming Odoc 3.0. We he=
ld productive in-person meetings in Paris to discuss crucial design aspects=
 such as the CLI, source code rendering, and references. These discussions =
led to the publications of RFCs for the various components of the design sp=
ecification.
</p>

<p>
We also started implementing a new Odoc driver that adheres to the new desi=
gn for testing purposes, and began prototyping several of the new features.
</p>

<p>
While discussions on the RFCs and specific features are still ongoing, we a=
re very excited to have a solid set of design specifications under communit=
y review and to have begun implementing key parts of the new design.

<b>Summary:</b>
</p>

<p>
The past few months have seen fantastic progress on releasing Merlin's proj=

 performance improvements have been made on the indexing tool. The <a href=

en and under review. That PR as well as the small LSP patch to support the =
feature are about to be merged.
</p>

<p>
The PR on Merlin also adds support for the feature in the Merlin server plu=
g-in for Emacs. Support for the Merlin server plug-in for Vim has been adde=
d separately. All editor plug-ins based on LSP will support the new feature=
 automatically.

<div class=3D"outline-text-4" id=3D"text-orgdbceec3">
<p>
The OCaml Cookbook is a place where OCaml developers share how to solve com=
mon tasks using packages from the ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
A recipe is a code sample and explanations on how to perform a task using a=
 combination of open source libraries.
</p>

<p>
The Cookbook is live at <a href=3D"https://ocaml.org/cookbook">ocaml.org/co=
okbook</a>, but there are not a lot of recipes published yet.
</p>

<p>
When the cookbook was merged, all pull requests to the cookbook branch were=
 automatically closed. We recreated these pull requests and they are ready =
for review.
</p>

<p>
Here's how you can help:

<div class=3D"outline-text-4" id=3D"text-orgfbb8284">
<p>
This month, we made some progress towards adding videos from the OCaml comm=
unity (e.g., from YouTube and watch.ocaml.org) to the OCaml Planet.
</p>

<p>
Since the size of the OCaml Planet RSS feed grew so large that automation t=
ools (<code>dlvr.it</code>) could no longer process it, we reduced the time=
frame for posts to show up in the RSS feed to the last 90 days.
</p>

<p>
Contributor <a href=3D"https://github.com/ishar19">@ishar19</a> opened a pu=
ll request to add an RSS feed for the Community/Events page. This will allo=
w posting new events to various social media automatically and allow you to=
 subscribe to the Events RSS feed with a RSS reader of your choice.
</p>

<p>
We have <a href=3D"https://www.figma.com/file/7hmoWkQP9PgLTfZCqiZMWa/OCaml-=
