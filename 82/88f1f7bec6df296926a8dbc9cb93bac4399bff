First International Workshop on Choreographic Programming co-located with P=
LDI 2024

One-day event, TBD within 24=9628th of June 2024, Copenhagen, Denmark

https://pldi24.sigplan.org/home/cp-2024

Important dates=20
---------------
 - Submission deadline: March 22nd, 2024 (AoE)
 - Notification to authors: May 3rd, 2024 (AoE)
 - Workshop day: TBD in week 26

Theme and Topics
----------------
Choreographies are coordination plans for concurrent and distributed system=
s, which define the roles of the involved participants and how they are sup=
posed to work together. In the paradigm of choreographic programming (CP), =
choreographies are programs that can be compiled to executable implementati=
ons.

CP originated primarily in the context of process calculi, with preliminary=
 work done to establish its foundations and experiment with implementations=
. Recently, several proposals have shown that one can adapt CP to work in s=
ynergy with mainstream programming paradigms, such as object-oriented and f=
unctional programming. These works substantiate the interest of a growing c=
ommunity of researchers and practitioners in evolving CP into a mature para=
digm, able to improve the productivity and reliability of programming concu=
rrent and distributed systems.

The aim of this workshop is to catalyse the community around CP by soliciti=
ng contributions in the following topics:
 - Theory and models of choreographic programming.
 - Design and implementation of choreographic programming languages, encomp=
assing both standalone and library-based implementations.
 - Design and implementation of runtime systems for choreographic programmi=
ng.
 - Verification and testing of choreographic programs.
 - Type systems for choreographic languages.
 - Interactions with software engineering (e.g., software requirements, des=
ign, construction, testing, analysis, and maintenance and software developm=
ent methodologies).
 - Fault tolerance and reliability in the context of choreographic programm=
ing.
 - Synergies and comparisons with adjacent approaches for concurrent and di=
stributed programming (e.g., multitier programming).

Contributions and Evaluation
----------------------------
Contributions can be work in progress, scientific work published or submitt=
ed for publication, tutorials, or practical experience reports.=20

Submissions should be no more than 6 pages excluding bibliography, using th=
e ACM Proceedings format. Templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be fou=
nd at the SIGPLAN author information page.=20

Submissions will be evaluated following a lightweight double-blind review p=
rocess.=20
