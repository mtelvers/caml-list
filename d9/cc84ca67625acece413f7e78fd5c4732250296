PACMPL Issue POPL 2026 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming
languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors
of
papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2026 will be invited to present their
work
in the POPL conference in January 2026, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN,
in
cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.

POPL 2026 Website: https://popl26.sigplan.org/

Call for Papers:
https://conf.researchr.org/track/POPL-2026/POPL-2026-popl-research-papers

Submission deadline: July 10 2025 AOE

Double-Blind Review FAQ:
https://conf.researchr.org/track/POPL-2026/POPL-2026-popl-research-papers#d=
ouble-blind-reviewing


### Organization

Conference Location: Rennes, France

Conference Dates: January 11-17, 2026

General Chair: Sandrine Blazy, University of Rennes

Program Chair: Suresh Jagannathan, Purdue University

Program Committee:
https://popl26.sigplan.org/committee/POPL-2026-popl-research-papers-program=
-committee


### Scope

Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of
all
aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical
and
experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks t=
o
experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring
contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or
application of programming languages.


### Evaluation Criteria

The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each
submission
as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience.
All
papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness,
and
clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both
general and
technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it
is
significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing
technical
papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page:
https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/.

Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly
enforced.


### Double-Blind Reviewing Process

POPL 2026 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the on=
e
used in recent years (POPL 2023 - 2025) but different from the lightweight
double-blind process used before then). This means that identities of
authors
will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance
decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted
papers.
The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors=
.


* **Submissions**: Authors must omit their names and institutions from thei=
r
  paper submissions. In addition, references to authors=E2=80=99 own prior =
work
should
  be in the third person (e.g., not =E2=80=9CWe build on our previous work =
=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D but
rather
  =E2=80=9CWe build on the work of =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D).

* **Supplementary material**: Authors are permitted to provide supplementar=
y
  material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, o=
r
  experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but
are
  not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single
file,
  such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementar=
y
  material.

* **Author response**: In responding to reviews, authors should not say
anything
  that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed
to
  reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process.

* **Dissemination of work under submission**: Authors are welcome to
disseminate
  their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal
  website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to
turn
  off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not
take
  steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of
the
  Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing th=
e
  work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the
  community.

The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and
external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to
make
it impossible for them to discover the authors=E2=80=99 identities if they =
were to
try.
In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens
the
quality of the submission.

However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above
restrictions
is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases,
the
authors should contact the Program Chair to discuss the situation and how t=
o
handle it.

The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing addresses many common scenarios and
answers
many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas an=
d
trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind
rules
or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ,
please
contact the Program Chair for guidance.

### Evaluation Process

POPL 2026 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monito=
r
reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not
enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.

As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to
reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional.
A
response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews;
in
particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will
write a
short reaction to these author responses.

The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use
synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is
disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input fro=
m
other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review
Committee,
though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers.
Reviews
will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee=
=E2=80=99s
decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.

To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers
will
be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short
description of the changes made to the final version of the paper,
including how
the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That
the
changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to
acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a
satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or
risk
rejection.

For additional information about the reviewing process, see: [Principles of
POPL](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/POPL/Principles/), a presentation
of
the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL
2026,
policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the
Principles of
POPL document.


### Submission Site Information

The submission site is https://popl26.hotcrp.com.

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last
submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission
site
requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and
potential
conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline wil=
l
need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentiall=
y
undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).

The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 10, 2025 anywhere on earth (AOE):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth


### Conflicts of Interest

For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare
all
potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission.
This
includes marking PC conflicts as well as =E2=80=9COther Conflicts (external=
)=E2=80=9D. A
conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review
which may
be infeasible to replace.

Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D.=
,
post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and
proposals; for
two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large
companies
or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same
institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people
with
financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.

If a possible reviewer does not meet the above criteria, please do not
identify
him/her as conflicted. Doing so could be viewed as an attempt to prevent a
qualified, but possibly skeptical reviewer from reviewing your paper. If yo=
u
nevertheless believe that a reviewer who does not meet the above criteria i=
s
conflicted, or if you are unsure about a possible conflict, you may
identify the
person and send a note to the PC Chair. Declaring a spurious conflict with
the
aim of excluding otherwise qualified reviewers can be grounds for desk
rejection.

### Submission Guidelines

Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full
anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper
submissions:

* Each paper should have no more than **25 pages of text, excluding
  bibliography**, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the `acmart` LaTeX
  class with `acmsmall` option). It is a single-column page layout with a
10 pt
  font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page
layouts. In
  this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in
  (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a
larger
  text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for
LaTeX
  can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information
  page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/), and further information
  about PACMPL submissions can be found on the [PACMPL author guidelines
  page](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmpl/author-guidelines). PACMPL does
not
  support submissions in Microsoft Word.

* We strongly encourage use of the `review` and `screen` options in order t=
o
  make submissions easier to review.

* Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be
either
  author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric=
.

* Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper=
.
  Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until
the
  deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the
  version reviewed.

* Submitted papers must adhere to the [SIGPLAN Republication
  Policy](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/) and th=
e
  [ACM Policy on
  Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview
).
  Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, o=
r
  similar forums of publication are not allowed.

* Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their
  submissions, but it must be fully anonymized.

* Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and
  external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form.

* Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP
submission
  form labeled "Confidential Comments for the Program Chair". This
information
  need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for
  example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or
  about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the
  discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information.

* If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive
issue
  with the Program Chair (or communicating via the "Confidential Comments"
field
  in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the
  Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence.

* Submissions from PC members and Associate Chairs (except the Program
Chair)
  are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other
submissions.
  This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the
SIGPLAN
  Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind
review and
  whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a
higher
  standard.

### Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit
supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact
Evaluation is
run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts
support
the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly
encouraged but
voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.
Papers
that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a
seal
of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers ar=
e
encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of
the
proceedings, by including them as =E2=80=9Csource materials=E2=80=9D in the=
 ACM Digital
Library.

### Copyright, Publication, and Presentation

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed
scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use.
Authors
are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their wor=
k
with the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY)
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which grants reader=
s
liberal (re-)use rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following
publication rights:

* Author licenses the work with a [Creative Commons
  license](https://creativecommons.org/), retains copyright, and
(implicitly)
  grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice).
* Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive
permission
  to publish license.
* Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive
permission to
  publish license.
* Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights,
corresponding to ACM=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cauthor pays=E2=80=9D option.

While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to
voluntarily cover the article processing charge, payment is not required fo=
r
publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for
funding
open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term
while
reducing short-term risk.

All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have
the
option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official
publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM
Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of
the
conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any
patent
filings related to published work.

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to give a short talk (roughly 25
minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.
Authors
who wish to present but who cannot attend in person will be provided with
some
option for remote presentation, as well as some mechanism for remote
interaction
with conference participants.

### Important update on ACM=E2=80=99s new open access publishing model for =
2026 ACM
Conferences!

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM
publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100%
Open
Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access
articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article
Processing Charges (APCs). With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM
Open, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs
from
authors or conferences (currently, around 70-75%).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an
APC
to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or
discretionary
waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult
the
list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers
and
Discounts Policy. Keep in mind that waivers are rare and are granted based
on
specific criteria set by ACM.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has
approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more
time
for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer: $250 APC for
ACM/SIG
members and $350 for non-members.

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are
encouraged
to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this
transition
period.

This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled
for
2026.


### Distinguished Paper Awards

At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2026 will be designated as
Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committe=
e
thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance,
originality,
significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will b=
e
made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional
review
process.

iled below, will be strictly<br>enforced.<br><br><br>### Double-Blind Revie=
wing Process<br><br>POPL 2026 will use a full double-blind reviewing proces=
s (similar to the one<br>used in recent years (POPL 2023 - 2025) but differ=
ent from the lightweight<br>double-blind process used before then). This me=
ans that identities of authors<br>will not be made visible to reviewers unt=
il after conditional-acceptance<br>decisions have been made, and then only =
for the conditionally-accepted papers.<br>The use of full double-blind revi=
ewing has several consequences for authors.<br><br><br>* **Submissions**: A=
uthors must omit their names and institutions from their<br>=C2=A0 paper su=
bmissions. In addition, references to authors=E2=80=99 own prior work shoul=
d<br>=C2=A0 be in the third person (e.g., not =E2=80=9CWe build on our prev=
ious work =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D but rather<br>=C2=A0 =E2=80=9CWe build on the =
work of =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D).<br><br>* **Supplementary material**: Authors a=
re permitted to provide supplementary<br>=C2=A0 material (e.g., detailed pr=
oofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or<br>=C2=A0 experimental data=
) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are<br>=C2=A0 not r=
equired to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file,<br>=
=C2=A0 such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplem=
entary<br>=C2=A0 material.<br><br>* **Author response**: In responding to r=
eviews, authors should not say anything<br>=C2=A0 that reveals their identi=
ty, since author identities will not be revealed to<br>=C2=A0 reviewers at =
that stage of the reviewing process.<br><br>* **Dissemination of work under=
 submission**: Authors are welcome to disseminate<br>=C2=A0 their ideas and=
 post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal<br>=C2=A0 website,=
 institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn<br>=C2=
=A0 off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should n=
ot take<br>=C2=A0 steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities=
 to members of the<br>=C2=A0 Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting P=
C members or publicizing the<br>=C2=A0 work on widely-visible social media =
or major mailing lists used by the<br>=C2=A0 community.<br><br>The purpose =
of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and<br>external =
reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make<br>i=
t impossible for them to discover the authors=E2=80=99 identities if they w=
ere to try.<br>In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymi=
ty that weakens the<br>quality of the submission.<br><br>However, there are=
 occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions<br>is truly di=
fficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the<br>auth=
ors should contact the Program Chair to discuss the situation and how to<br=
>handle it.<br><br>The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing addresses many common =
scenarios and answers<br>many common questions about this topic. But there =
remain many grey areas and<br>trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how =
to interpret the double-blind rules<br>or you encounter a complex case that=
 is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please<br>contact the Program Chair for=
 guidance.<br><br>### Evaluation Process<br><br>POPL 2026 will have five As=
sociate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor<br>reviews, solicit exter=
nal expert reviews for submissions when there is not<br>enough expertise on=
 the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.<br><br>As in previous =
years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to<br>reviews, as in=
dicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A<br>response=
 must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in<br>p=
articular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will writ=
e a<br>short reaction to these author responses.<br><br>The Review Committe=
e (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use<br>synchronous virt=
ual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is<br>disagreement among=
 reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from<br>other experts=
 in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee,<br>though =
experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews<br>=
will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee=
=E2=80=99s<br>decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the d=
ecision.<br><br>To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, a=
ll POPL papers will<br>be conditionally accepted; authors will be required =
to submit a short<br>description of the changes made to the final version o=
f the paper, including how<br>the changes address any requirements imposed =
by the Review Committee. That the<br>changes are sufficient will be confirm=
ed by the original reviewers prior to<br>acceptance to POPL. Authors of con=
ditionally accepted papers must submit a<br>satisfactory revision to the Re=
view Committee by the requested deadline or risk<br>rejection.<br><br>For a=
dditional information about the reviewing process, see: [Principles of<br>P=

<br>The submission site is <a href=3D"https://popl26.hotcrp.com">https://po=
pl26.hotcrp.com</a>.<br><br>Authors can submit multiple times prior to the =
deadline. Only the last<br>submission will be reviewed. There is no abstrac=
t deadline. The submission site<br>requires entering author names and affil=
iations, relevant topics, and potential<br>conflicts. Addition or removal o=
f authors after the submission deadline will<br>need to be approved by the =
Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially<br>undermines the goal of=
 eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).<br><br>The submission dead=

bmission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all<br>pote=
ntial conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This=
<br>includes marking PC conflicts as well as =E2=80=9COther Conflicts (exte=
rnal)=E2=80=9D. A<br>conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to=
 a voided review which may<br>be infeasible to replace.<br><br>Conflicts sh=
ould be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D.,<br>post-do=
c; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for<b=
r>two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large com=
panies<br>or different locations of research institutes are considered to b=
e the same<br>institution; for two years after leaving an institution), bet=
ween people with<br>financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or=
 relatives.<br><br>If a possible reviewer does not meet the above criteria,=
 please do not identify<br>him/her as conflicted. Doing so could be viewed =
as an attempt to prevent a<br>qualified, but possibly skeptical reviewer fr=
om reviewing your paper. If you<br>nevertheless believe that a reviewer who=
 does not meet the above criteria is<br>conflicted, or if you are unsure ab=
out a possible conflict, you may identify the<br>person and send a note to =
the PC Chair. Declaring a spurious conflict with the<br>aim of excluding ot=
herwise qualified reviewers can be grounds for desk<br>rejection.<br><br>##=
# Submission Guidelines<br><br>Prior to the paper submission deadline, auth=
ors should upload their full<br>anonymized paper. Here are some key require=
ments concerning paper submissions:<br><br>* Each paper should have no more=
 than **25 pages of text, excluding<br>=C2=A0 bibliography**, using the PAC=
MPL format (specifically, the `acmart` LaTeX<br>=C2=A0 class with `acmsmall=
` option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt<br>=C2=A0 font, 1=
2 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In<br>=
=C2=A0 this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.8=
84 in<br>=C2=A0 (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller f=
onts or a larger<br>=C2=A0 text block) is grounds for summary rejection. Th=
e PACMPL template for LaTeX<br>=C2=A0 can be found at the [SIGPLAN author i=
nformation<br>=C2=A0 page](<a href=3D"https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Aut=
hor/">https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/</a>), and further informati=
on<br>=C2=A0 about PACMPL submissions can be found on the [PACMPL author gu=
idelines<br>=C2=A0 page](<a href=3D"https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmpl/autho=
r-guidelines">https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmpl/author-guidelines</a>). PAC=
MPL does not<br>=C2=A0 support submissions in Microsoft Word.<br><br>* We s=
trongly encourage use of the `review` and `screen` options in order to<br>=
=C2=A0 make submissions easier to review.<br><br>* Authors may choose which=
 citation format they wish to use, which can be either<br>=C2=A0 author-yea=
r (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric.<br><br>* S=
ubmissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper.<b=
r>=C2=A0 Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up=
 until the<br>=C2=A0 deadline, but the last version submitted before the de=
adline will be the<br>=C2=A0 version reviewed.<br><br>* Submitted papers mu=
st adhere to the [SIGPLAN Republication<br>=C2=A0 Policy](<a href=3D"https:=
//www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/">https://www.sigplan.or=

ors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and<br>=C2=
=A0 external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form.<br><br>* Authors may=
 include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission<br>=C2=
=A0 form labeled &quot;Confidential Comments for the Program Chair&quot;. T=
his information<br>=C2=A0 need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform =
the Program Chair, for<br>=C2=A0 example, about sensitive issues concerning=
 a conflict with a PC member or<br>=C2=A0 about supplementary material that=
 cannot be anonymized. It is left to the<br>=C2=A0 discretion of the Progra=
m Chair what to do with this information.<br><br>* If for some reason an au=
thor feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue<br>=C2=A0 with the Pr=
ogram Chair (or communicating via the &quot;Confidential Comments&quot; fie=
ld<br>=C2=A0 in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with=
 any of the<br>=C2=A0 Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issu=
e in confidence.<br><br>* Submissions from PC members and Associate Chairs =
(except the Program Chair)<br>=C2=A0 are permitted and will not be handled =
any differently than other submissions.<br>=C2=A0 This is in accordance wit=

ccess publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences!<br><br>Starting January 1,=
 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM<br>publications, i=
ncluding those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open<br>Access.=
 Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access<br>articl=
es with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article<br>Proce=
ssing Charges (APCs). With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM<br>O=
pen, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs =
from<br>authors or conferences (currently, around 70-75%).<br><br>Authors f=
rom institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC<br>t=
o publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionar=
y<br>waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please con=
sult the<br>list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the A=
PC Waivers and<br>Discounts Policy. Keep in mind that waivers are rare and =
are granted based on<br>specific criteria set by ACM.<br><br>Understanding =
that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has<br>approved a =
temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time<br>fo=
r institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer: $250 APC for ACM/S=
IG<br>members and $350 for non-members.<br><br>This represents a 65% discou=
nt, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged<br>to help advocate for =

Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee<br>thinks sh=
ould be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality,<br>si=
gnificance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be<=
