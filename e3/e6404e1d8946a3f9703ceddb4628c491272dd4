The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop: ACM SIGPLAN Workshop
September 9, 2023 (Saturday) Seattle, WA, USA and also online
(two days after main ICFP)

Call for presentations: https://icfp23.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2023
Talk proposal submission deadline: Thursday June 1st, 2023

(Please redistribute widely.)

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together the OCaml
community, including users of OCaml in industry, academia, hobbyists
and the free software community.

OCaml 2023 will be co-located with ICFP 2023, which will take place in
Seattle, US. We aim to organize it as a hybrid event, so that people
can attend and even give talks remotely: talks will be streamed in
real-time, and virtual participants will be able to chat and ask
questions in writing.

Scope
-----

Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
the language and its programming environment, including, for
example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not
  limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
  or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design
  rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
  deployments in unusual situations.

Presentations
-------------

It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
at a later time.

The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
program committee will decide which presentations should be
delivered as posters or talks.

Submission
----------

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at

        https://icfp23-ocaml.hotcrp.com/

providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

Important dates
---------------

Thursday 1st June (any time zone):    Abstract submission deadline
Thursday 6h July:                     Author notification
Saturday 9th September:               OCaml Workshop

ML family workshop and post-proceedings
---------------------------------------

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with
general issues of the ML-style programming and type systems,
focuses on more research-oriented work that is less specific to
a language in particular (OCaml). There is an overlap between
the two workshops, and we have occasionally transferred
presentations from one to the other in the past. The authors who
feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to
mention it at submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.
