> on any language in particular, is more research-oriented, and deals
> with general issues of ML-style programming and type systems. Yet
> there is an overlap, which we are keen to explore in various ways. The
> authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged
> to mention it at submission time or contact the program chairs.

      # Higher-order, Typed, Inferred, Strict: ACM SIGPLAN ML Family
      Workshop
      <br>
      <br>
      ML (originally, “Meta Language”) is a family of programming
      languages
      <br>
      that includes dialects known as Standard ML, OCaml, and F#, among
      <br>
      others. The development of these languages has inspired a large
      amount
      <br>
      of computer science research, both practical and theoretical.
      <br>
      <br>
      The ML Family Workshop is an established informal workshop aiming
      to
      <br>
      recognize the entire extended ML family and to provide the forum
      to
      <br>
      present and discuss common issues: all aspects of the design,
      <br>
      semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching of
      the
      <br>
      members of the ML family. We also encourage presentations from
      related
      <br>
      languages (such as Haskell, Scala, Rust, Nemerle, Links, Koka, F*,
      <br>
      Eff, ATS, etc), to promote the exchange of ideas and experience.
      The
      <br>
      ML family workshop will be held in close coordination with the
      OCaml
      <br>
      Users and Developers Workshop.
      <br>
      <br>
      ## Format
      <br>
      <br>
      The ML 2024 workshop will continue the informal approach followed
      <br>
      since 2010. Presentations are selected by the program committee
      from
      <br>
      submitted proposals. There are no published proceedings, so
      <br>
      contributions may be submitted for publication elsewhere. The main
      <br>
      criterion is the promoting and informing the development of the
      entire
      <br>
      extended ML family and delivering a lively workshop atmosphere. We
      <br>
      particularly encourage talks about works in progress,
      presentations of
      <br>
      negative results (things that were expected to but did not quite
      work
      <br>
      out) and informed positions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Each presentation should take 20-25 minutes. The exact time will
      be
      <br>
      decided based on scheduling constraints.
      <br>
      <br>
      We plan the workshop to an be in-person event with remote
      <br>
      participation (streamed live). Speakers are generally expected to
      <br>
      present in person (we will work to make remote presentations
      <br>
      possible).
      <br>
      <br>
      The 2024 ML family workshop is co-located with ICFP 2024 and will
      take
      <br>
      place on September the 6th in Milan, Italy.
      <br>
      <br>
      ## Scope
      <br>
      <br>
      We seek presentations on topics including (but not limited to):
      <br>
      <br>
      * Language design: abstraction, higher forms of polymorphism,
      <br>
       concurrency, distribution and mobility, staging, extensions for
      <br>
       semi-structured data, generic programming, object systems, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Implementation: compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial
      <br>
       evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, foreign function
      <br>
       interfaces, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Type systems: inference, effects, modules, contracts,
      specifications
      <br>
       and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Applications: case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers,
      cross-language
      <br>
       interoperability, functional data structures, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Semantics of ML-family languages: operational and denotational
      <br>
       semantics, program equivalence, parametricity, mechanization,
      etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      We specifically encourage reporting what did not meet expectations
      or
      <br>
      what, despite all efforts, did not work to satisfaction.
      <br>
      <br>
      Four kinds of submissions are solicited: Research Presentations,
      <br>
      Experience Reports, Demos, and Informed Positions.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Research Presentations: Research presentations should describe
      new
      <br>
       ideas, experimental results, or significant advances in
      ML-related
      <br>
       projects. We especially encourage presentations that describe
      work
      <br>
       in progress, that outline a future research agenda, or that
      <br>
       encourage lively discussion. These presentations should be
      <br>
       structured in a way which can be, at least in part, of interest
      to
      <br>
       (advanced) users.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Experience Reports: Users are invited to submit Experience
      Reports
      <br>
       about their use of ML and related languages. These presentations
      do
      <br>
       not need to contain original research but they should tell an
      <br>
       interesting story to researchers or other advanced users, such as
      an
      <br>
       innovative or unexpected use of advanced features or a
      description
      <br>
       of the challenges they are facing or attempting to solve.
      <br>
      <br>
      * Demos: Live demonstrations or short tutorials should show new
      <br>
       developments, interesting prototypes, or work in progress, in the
      <br>
       form of tools, libraries, or applications built on or related to
      ML
      <br>
       and related languages. (You will need to provide all the hardware
      <br>
       and software required for your demo; the workshop organizers are
      <br>
       only able to provide a projector.)
      <br>
      <br>
      * Informed Positions: A justified argument for or against a
      language
      <br>
       feature. The argument must be substantiated, either theoretically
      <br>
       (e.g., by a demonstration of (un)soundness, an inference
      algorithm,
      <br>
       a complexity analysis), empirically or by substantial experience.
      <br>
       Personal experience is accepted as justification so long as it is
      <br>
       extensive and illustrated with concrete examples.
      <br>
      <br>
      ## Submission details
      <br>
      <br>
      Submissions must be in the PDF format and have a short summary
      <br>
      (abstract) at the beginning. Submissions in the categories of
      <br>
      Experience Reports, Demos, or Informed Positions should indicate
      so in
      <br>
      the title or subtitle. The point of the submission should be clear
      <br>
      from its two first pages (PC members are not obligated to read any
      <br>
      further.)
      <br>
      <br>
      Submissions must be uploaded to the workshop submission website
      before
      <br>
      the submission deadline.
      <br>
      <br>
      Only the short summary/abstract of accepted submissions will be
      <br>
      published on the conference website. After acceptance, authors
      will
      <br>
      have the opportunity to attach or link to that summary any
      relevant

      ## Coordination with the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop
      <br>
      <br>
      The OCaml workshop is seen as more practical and is dedicated in
      <br>
      significant part to OCaml community building and the development
      of
      <br>
      the OCaml system. In contrast, the ML family workshop is not
      focused
      <br>
      on any language in particular, is more research-oriented, and
      deals
      <br>
      with general issues of ML-style programming and type systems. Yet
      <br>
      there is an overlap, which we are keen to explore in various ways.
      The
      <br>
      authors who feel their submission fits both workshops are
      encouraged
      <br>
      to mention it at submission time or contact the program chairs.
