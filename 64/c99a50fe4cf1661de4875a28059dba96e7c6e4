Hello!

I personally don't know of any. Which is somewhat strange come to
think of it.  In the past, the questions about MetaOCaml were either
posted on this list (like yours) or sent to me privately.

That does look quite interesting. A student once used offshoring for
OpenCL (which is quite C but not exactly). Incidentally, one of the
tests of MetaOCaml, at the end of
        OCAMLROOT/metalib/test/offshore_simple.ml
is a very simplified version of some of that code.

Overlook -- or, better, ignorance. I put trx.cmx into the libpath
because otherwise the native compiler complains. I didn't think
trx.cmo is needed for anything. It is part of ocamlcommon.cma though.
